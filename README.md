# Crop Prediction Model

## Overview
This project implements a crop prediction model to determine the best crop for a farmer based on soil parameters and environmental factors. The model predicts the suitable crop based on the following parameters:
- N (Nitrogen)
- P (Phosphorus)
- K (Potassium)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH level
- Rainfall

## Model Technique
The model utilizes multiple technique to predict the most suitable crop for the given soil and environmental,
